            <p class="text" ><b>Name:</b> <u>Rio Romera Barcelon</u></p>

            <p>Hey! I’m someone who loves to enjoy life through simple pleasures. Video games are definitely <br>one of my favorite ways to relax and escape into different worlds. <br> Whether I’m playing solo or with friends, gaming is my go-to way to unwind. Alongside that, I’m a huge fan of sleep—who isn’t, <br>right? There’s something about getting a good night’s rest that helps me recharge, so you’ll <br>often find me napping or just enjoying my sleep. <br>

                When I’m not gaming or sleeping, I’m all about food. I love cooking my own meals—there’s <br>something so satisfying about preparing a dish from scratch, and I always feel <br>accomplished when it turns out great. Cooking is a fun way for me to get creative in the <br>kitchen, and I take pride in knowing exactly what’s going into my food. Eating is <br>definitely a highlight too; I’m always ready to dive into whatever’s cooking, whether it’s <br>something simple or a little more complex. <br>
                
                Basketball is another passion of mine. I love hitting the court, whether it’s playing a pickup <br>game with friends or just shooting hoops on my own. There’s something about the flow of <br>the game and the challenge that really draws me in. But don’t expect me to be into <br>coding—it’s not my thing at all. In fact, I try to steer clear of anything that involves <br>sitting in front of a screen and wrestling with code for hours. It just doesn’t vibe with <br>me, and I’d much rather spend my time doing something more active or enjoyable. <br>
                
                Overall, I’m all about finding the right balance between my hobbies and enjoying life as it <br>comes. Whether I’m gaming, cooking, or playing basketball, I’m always looking for ways to <br>have fun and take it easy. If you’re into any of these things, we’d probably get along <br>just fine<p> <br>

    <h2>My Life story</h2>
    <figure>
        <figcaption><b>Childhood:</b></figcaption>
    
    <p>I grew up in a small town, spending my days outside—riding bikes, playing soccer, <br>and swimming at the local pool. My dad taught me how to ride a bike, and from <br>there, I felt unstoppable. Video games became my escape, and I spent countless <br> hours playing on our old console.</p>

         <figcaption><b>Teenage Years:</b></figcaption>
         <p>High school was a mix of fun and struggles. I joined the basketball team for the <br>camaraderie and discipline, even if I wasn’t the best player. Gaming was a huge part <br>of my life, especially those late-night marathons with friends. School was tough, and <br>I struggled with subjects like coding, but I found my escape through sports and <br>games.</p>

         <figcaption><b>Adulthood:</b></figcaption>
         <p>Now as an adult, I work as a line cook and love experimenting with <br>food, whether at work or at home. I still play basketball casually and <br>keep up with video games as a way to unwind. Though I’m no fan of <br> coding, I’ve learned to appreciate the simpler joys in life and focus on <br>what makes me happiest—cooking, sports, and gaming.</p>
