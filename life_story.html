                <figcaption><b>Childhood:</b></figcaption>
            
            <p>I grew up in a small town, spending my days outside—riding bikes, playing soccer, <br>and swimming at the local pool. My dad taught me how to ride a bike, and from <br>there, I felt unstoppable. Video games became my escape, and I spent countless <br> hours playing on our old console.</p>
        
                 <figcaption><b>Teenage Years:</b></figcaption>
                 <p>High school was a mix of fun and struggles. I joined the basketball team for the <br>camaraderie and discipline, even if I wasn’t the best player. Gaming was a huge part <br>of my life, especially those late-night marathons with friends. School was tough, and <br>I struggled with subjects like coding, but I found my escape through sports and <br>games.</p>
        
                 <figcaption><b>Adulthood:</b></figcaption>
                 <p>Now as an adult, I work as a line cook and love experimenting with <br>food, whether at work or at home. I still play basketball casually and <br>keep up with video games as a way to unwind. Though I’m no fan of <br> coding, I’ve learned to appreciate the simpler joys in life and focus on <br>what makes me happiest—cooking, sports, and gaming.</p>
