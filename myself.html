                    <p style="font-size: 24px; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"text-indent: 50px; class="about p">Hey! I’m someone who loves to enjoy life through simple pleasures. <br> Video games are definitely one of my favorite ways to relax and escape into different worlds. Whether I’m playing solo or with friends, gaming is my go-to way to unwind. <br> 
                        Alongside that, I’m a huge fan of sleep—who isn’t, right? There’s something about getting a good night’s rest that helps me recharge, so you’ll often find me napping or just enjoying my sleep. <br>
                        When I’m not gaming or sleeping, I’m all about food. I love cooking my own meals—there’s something so satisfying about preparing a dish from scratch, and I always feel accomplished when it <br> 
                        turns out great. <br><br>
                        
                        Cooking is a fun way for me to get creative in the kitchen, and I take pride in knowing exactly what’s going into my food. Eating is definitely a highlight too; I’m always ready to <br> 
                        dive into whatever’s cooking, whether it’s something simple or a little more complex.
                        Basketball is another passion of mine. I love hitting the court, whether it’s playing a pickup game with friends or just shooting hoops on my own. There’s something about the flow of the game and the challenge that really draws me in. <br> <br>
                        
                        But don’t expect me to be into coding—it’s not my thing at <br>
                        all. In fact, I try to steer clear of anything that involves sitting in front of a screen and wrestling with code for hours. It just doesn’t vibe with me, and I’d much rather spend my time doing <br>
                        something more active or enjoyable.
                        Overall, I’m all about finding the right balance between my hobbies and enjoying life as it comes. Whether I’m gaming, cooking, or playing basketball, I’m <br> always looking for ways to have fun and take it easy. If you’re into any of these things, we’d probably get along just fine.<p><br>
